# Vita-DFE
DFE - Debug Features Enabler ( or Dex/Devkit Features Extender if you have a dex/tool unit ) for Playstation Vita, Playstation Vita TV and Playstation TV.
Current state: Alpha, no ETA.
# Basic Usage:
- Enable/Disable debug features
   Installs/Uninstalls a ITU lv3 Project Deepload, which adds following patches:
    - Spoof the device to a internal test unit 
    - QA flags stuff (More info soonTM)
    - Allow loading all module types ( CEX/DEX/TOOL )
    - Set activation type to prototype/qa (3222+ days)
    - Spoof CP Data
    - Allow debugging via USB

   Installs/Uninstalls MultiHen framework along with bighooker and vshpatcher.
- Current Status
   Displays some info about system status (gathered by this app).

# WARNING
The Enable/Disable debug features option flashes Project Deepload into MBR, remember that every flash brings risk of a PERMAMENT, UNRECOVERABLE BRICK, so I recommend doing it on a clean os (freshly after boot and without bigger plugins).
